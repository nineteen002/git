MERGE: Combines the work of independent branches.
	
Base Branch: Usually longer than topic branch, usually called master

MERGE COMMIT: The commit of topic branch is included in the base branch

TYPES OF MERGES:
	- Fast-forward merge
	- Merge commit
	- Squash merge
	- Rebase


FAST-FORWARD MERGE:
Moves the base branch label to the tip of the topic branch.
ONLY possible if no other commits have been made to the base branch since the topic branch was made
	Steps:
		1) git checkout master
		2) git merge < branch name >
		3) git branch -d < branch name >

MERGE COMMIT: 
Combines the commits at the tips of the merged branches.
Places the result in the merge commit.
A merge commit ALWAYS has multiple parents.
	STEPS:	
		1) git checkout master
		2) git merge < branch name >
		3) git branch -d < branch name >

* Combining the work of multiple commits may cause a MERGE CONFLICT * 

MERGE CONFLICT: Occurs when both branches changes the same thing in different ways


* MERGE COMMIT (NO FAST-FORWARD):
	1) git checkout master
	2) git merge --no--ff < branch name >
	3) git branch -d < branch name>
